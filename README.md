Paprika
=======

Paprika is the senior design project of [@tsharman](http://github.com/tsharman) [@prashanthsadasivan](http://github.com/prashanthsadasivan) and [@ekoschik](http://github.com/ekoschik).

The web app was designed for auto mechanic shops. It allows mechanics to report the status of an order to their customers.

This is built with Django.
