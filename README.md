Paprika
=======

Paprika is the senior design project of [@tsharman](http://github.com/tsharman) [@prashanthsadasivan](http://github.com/prashanthsadasivan) and [@ekoschik](http://github.com/ekoschik).

The web app was designed for auto mechanic shops. It allows mechanics to report the status of an order to their customers.

This is built with Django.

Dependencies are in the requirements.txt file.

Add a local_settings.py file in the same directory as settings.py file. Set all the missing database variables.
